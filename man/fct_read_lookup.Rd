Note that this function is specific to a specific DB schema -
the form to query as well as the columns variable name are hard coded and 
would need to be adjusted if the DB change

Note also that the function is based on a token stored as an environment 
variable

 # Credentials set up as environment variables - 
 
 # token <- "activityinfotoken.."
 # print(Sys.setenv(ACTIVITYINFOTOKEN = token))   
 # Sys.getenv("ACTIVITYINFOTOKEN")
 # rm(token)
}
